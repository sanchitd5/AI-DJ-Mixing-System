"""
This module implements a track analysis engine that processes MP3 files from a setlist to extract comprehensive audio
features using the Librosa library. It analyzes tracks for tempo, key, energy, valence, danceability, structural
segments (including chorus detection), and enhances a setlist with these features, vibe labels, and transition suggestions.
The output is saved as a JSON file for use in DJ or event planning applications.
Key features:
- Extracts audio features such as BPM, key, energy, valence, danceability, and structural segments.
- Uses Krumhansl-Kessler profiles for key estimation and heuristic-based vocal detection.
- Applies beat tracking and optional machine learning for downbeat detection (with fallback logic).
- Detects chorus sections using self-similarity analysis on chroma features to identify repeated high-energy segments.
- Suggests DJ transitions between tracks based on BPM and energy differences.
- Sorts tracks within setlist segments by BPM for smoother transitions.
Dependencies:
- librosa: For audio feature extraction (e.g., chroma, MFCC, RMS).
- numpy: For numerical computations on audio features.
- sklearn: For PCA and StandardScaler (used in feature extraction).
- tensorflow: For loading a pre-trained downbeat detection model (optional).
- json, os: For handling JSON data and file operations.
- warnings: To suppress non-critical Numba/Librosa warnings.
- google-generativeai: For looking up BPM using Gemini API (assumed to be configured in the environment with API key).
